title: Things that I don't like about my OnePlus2

Few months ago I bought my [OnePlus2] after reading many articles about how good this phone is and how low **$349**
is for *'Flagship Killer'* as they call it.

My previous phone was Nexus 5 and I was very happy with quality that I got, unfortunately I can't say same about [OnePlus2].

## It hangs every time I need it very badly
I was aware about modified software that [OnePlus2] comes with, they claim that tuned software that comes with it saves
battery life a lot.

Maybe it is true, however after not using phone for a while it takes few seconds to start up. During that period my
phone is frozen and I can hardly do anything.

It really sucks, specially for important calls or if I want to check something quickly.

## Fingerprint sensor
At first fingerprint sensor was really cool feature that I was playing all day long, but it turned out to be really
big headache after using it for months.

It does not work properly in 80% of cases and I need to enter pin manually.

## Software update did not came
I expected to have Android M on it during Q1 of 2016, because that is what they promised. However it turned out that on
Q1 they just published beta version with manual upgrade guide.

That really sucks, because I love to have proper system upgrades instead of rooting phone and installing beta version on
it.

## What I would do if I had another chance?
If I could turn back time, for sure I would not buy [OnePlus2].

Instead I would wait a little and get [Nexus6P] with **$499.00** price, but way better quality.

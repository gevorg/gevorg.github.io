As I [complained](http://gevorg.me/Things-that-I-don't-like-about-my-OnePlus2/) about my [OnePlus2] few weeks ago, I think
it would be fair to write few good things about it. I decided to write
about it, because I finally got proper OS update and as you may 
notice from title, update fixed many problems that I had before.

## It hanged every time I needed it very badly
I guess it is because of 6th version of Android, but now it is awesome.
After update I never had a problem like frozen screen or hanging OS.

It would be fair to say that problem might also be related to 5th version
of Android that it was using before. In my opinion 5th version was really 
unstable and had lot of bugs, that were mostly fixed in 6th version.

## Fingerprint sensor, now works
It works now and I have to enter pin only in rare cases. 
So I am finally happy :)

## Software update came
It finally updated to 6th version and did it in a proper way. Update 
fixed the most of problems that I had before.

## Do I consider [OnePlus3]?
Sure, I think it makes sense to consider the next generation of [OnePlus2]
and hopefully it will not have hidden problems as [OnePlus2] had in the beginning.

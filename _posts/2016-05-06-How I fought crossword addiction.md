It might sound funny, but I had an addiction to crossword solving few years ago. It started just from few

As a true developer who was familiar with java technologies I decided to fight that habit using my skills.

than I ever did. I called it [flatback](http://gevorg.github.io/flatback/) and published all sources on GitHub.

    <article>
        <p>Few months ago I bought my <a href="https://oneplus.net/2">OnePlus2</a> after reading many articles about how good this phone is and how low <strong>$349</strong>
is for <em>‘Flagship Killer’</em> as they call it.</p>

<p>My previous phone was Nexus 5 and I was very happy with quality that I got, unfortunately I can’t say same about <a href="https://oneplus.net/2">OnePlus2</a>.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="it-hangs-every-time-i-need-it-very-badly">It hangs every time I need it very badly</h2>
<p>I was aware about modified software that <a href="https://oneplus.net/2">OnePlus2</a> comes with, they claim that tuned software that comes with it saves
battery life a lot.</p>

<p>Maybe it is true, however after not using phone for a while it takes few seconds to start up. During that period my
phone is frozen and I can hardly do anything.</p>

<p>It really sucks, specially for important calls or if I want to check something quickly.</p>

<h2 id="fingerprint-sensor">Fingerprint sensor</h2>
<p>At first fingerprint sensor was really cool feature that I was playing all day long, but it turned out to be really
big headache after using it for months.</p>

<p>It does not work properly in 80% of cases and I need to enter pin manually.</p>

<h2 id="software-update-did-not-came">Software update did not came</h2>
<p>I expected to have Android M on it during Q1 of 2016, because that is what they promised. However it turned out that on
Q1 they just published beta version with manual upgrade guide.</p>

<p>That really sucks, because I love to have proper system upgrades instead of rooting phone and installing beta version on
it.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-would-do-if-i-had-another-chance">What I would do if I had another chance?</h2>
<p>If I could turn back time, for sure I would not buy <a href="https://oneplus.net/2">OnePlus2</a>.</p>

<p>Instead I would wait a little and get <a href="http://consumer.huawei.com/minisite/worldwide/nexus6p/">Nexus6P</a> with <strong>$499.00</strong> price, but way better quality.</p>
